# Sum-of-Unary-Polynomials
Input：

①First line will be a positive integer T (T<=100), which is the number of messages.  
②The first line will be an integer n, which is the number of terms of the first polynomial. Then n lines will be the coefficients and exponents of the terms.  
③After n + 1 lines, there will be an integer m for the number of terms of the second polynomial. And m lines of (coefficient, exponent) pairs((These pairs will be given by in ascending order of exponent).
④(0 <= n, m <= 1000, all exponents are in the range [0,10^9], all coefficients are in the range [-10000, 10000])  

Output:  

For each message, print the polynomial with the same syntax as the sample shows.    
for instance:  

1  
2  
2 2  
3 3  
2  
1 2  
2 4  

3x^2+3x^3+2x^4
